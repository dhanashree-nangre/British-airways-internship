**Author:** Dhanashree Nangre

**Project:** British Airways Virtual Internship (Forage)

**Project Overview**

This repository contains the solutions for the British Airways virtual internship available on Forage. The project involves analyzing customer reviews and developing machine learning models to predict booking outcomes. The focus is on performing sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and creating a predictive random forest model to determine whether a booking will be made based on customer interactions and reviews.

**Repository Structure**

**1. BA_reviews.ipynb**

This Jupyter notebook contains Python code for performing:

**Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews (positive, negative, neutral) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

**Topic Modeling:** Extracting key themes and topics from customer reviews to identify frequent discussion points and areas of concern.

**Word Cloud and Graphical Representation:** Visualizing common words and patterns in the reviews using word clouds and charts to gain insights.

**2. BA ML model.ipynb**

This notebook contains the implementation of a Random Forest Machine Learning Model designed to predict whether a booking will be made or not based on customer data.
The model utilizes classification techniques to assess booking likelihood, providing insights for optimizing business strategies.

**3. Presentations**
